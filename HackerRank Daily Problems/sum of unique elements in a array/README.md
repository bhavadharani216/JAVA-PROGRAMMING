# 📌 Sum of Unique Elements in an Array

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` of size `length`.
Write a program to calculate and return the **sum of unique (non-duplicate) elements** present in the array.

If no unique element is found, return **0**.

The computed value will always lie within the integer range.

---

## 📥 Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer `n` — the size of the array.
2. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the array elements.

---

## 📤 Output Format

Print a single integer — the **sum of unique elements** in the array.

---

## 📌 Constraints

* No specific constraints given
* Values are within integer range

---

## 🧪 Sample Input

```
8
2 5 4 7 9 2 4 8
```

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```
29
```

---

## 💡 Explanation

* Elements **2** and **4** appear more than once → not included
* Unique elements → **5, 7, 9, 8**

Sum:

```
5 + 7 + 9 + 8 = 29
```
